# Deep Learning Functions

This is a place where I would like to write simple codes about deep learning in Matlab and Python. This learning method makes me realize and memorize the functions of deep learning and how to use them in Matlab and Python. Also, this method can train my coding skill. 

I keep uploading the approaches I learned ASAP.
